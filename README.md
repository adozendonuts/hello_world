# hello_world
My first ever PROPER repository

I don't really have much to talk about. I am learning this stuff for the second or third time. I like to teach myself things to the point where I am comfortable. It takes me longer to learn things as a result but overall I think it helps me create a stronger foundation with which to support my more creative endeavors. Once it becomes automatic, you have more cognitive resources to devote to other ideas.
